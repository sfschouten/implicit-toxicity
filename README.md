# implicit-toxicity
Project to find cases of implicit toxicity, i.e. cases that require inferring implied toxicity.

### Directories 
- `data-repos/`:  copies (with `git subtree`) of the repositories for each of the datasets we use.
- `src/toxic_impl/`: files with source code relevant for all approaches, and a submodule for 
each approach.
- `experiments/`: configurations used to obtain the experimental results.
